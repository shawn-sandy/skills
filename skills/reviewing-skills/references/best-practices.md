## Frontmatter Rules

Frontmatter appears between YAML delimiter pairs (`---`). Both fields are required.

```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name
description: Reviews X for Y. Use when the user asks to...
---
```

### Name Field

**Format requirements:**

| Requirement | Rule | Bad Example | Good Example |
|-------------|------|-------------|--------------|
| Character set | Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only | `My_Skill`, `mySkill`, `my skill` | `my-skill`, `skill-reviewer` |
| Length | ≤64 characters | (64+ char name) | `reviewing-skills` |
| Reserved words | Must not contain `anthropic` or `claude` as substring | `claude-helper`, `anthropic-audit` | `skill-reviewer`, `code-audit` |
| No version suffix | Do not include version in name | `skill-reviewer-v2` | `skill-reviewer` |

**Reserved word rule:** The check is a substring match. `claude-helper` fails because it contains `claude`. `claudemd-optimizer` also fails.

**Naming convention — prefer gerund form:**

| Style | Example | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Gerund (preferred) | `reviewing-skills`, `auditing-code` | Action in progress — matches how skills work |
| Noun (acceptable) | `skill-reviewer`, `code-auditor` | Clear but less idiomatic |
| Verb (avoid) | `review-skill`, `audit` | Imperative form — conflicts with command style |

---

### Description Field

**Requirements:**

| Requirement | Rule | Bad Example | Good Example |
|-------------|------|-------------|--------------|
| Length | ≤1024 characters | (1025+ char description) | (clear, concise description) |
| Person | Third person — no "I", "you", "we", "your" | "I will review your skill." | "Reviews SKILL.md files for quality." |
| Trigger phrase | Must contain "Use when..." | "This skill reviews code." | "Reviews code. Use when the user asks to check quality." |
| Capability statement | Third-person verb clause describing what the skill does/produces — distinct from the trigger phrase | "Use when the user asks to review SKILL.md files." (trigger-only) | "Reviews SKILL.md files for quality. Use when the user asks to audit a skill." |
| No XML tags | No `<example>`, `<user>`, or other XML | "Use when <user> asks..." | "Use when the user asks..." |
| No newlines | Single-paragraph description | Multi-line with `\n` | Single continuous sentence or two |

**Trigger phrase patterns (good examples):**

Pattern 1 — three-part (recommended): short label (≤80 chars) + capability sentence + trigger phrase:
```
Skill quality auditor. Reviews SKILL.md files against authoring best practices. Use when the user asks to audit, score, or check skill quality.
Frontmatter optimizer. Rewrites SKILL.md descriptions to three-part format (≤200 chars) and tunes disable-model-invocation. Use when the user asks to optimize SKILL.md frontmatter.
```

Pattern 2 — trigger first, capability second:
```
Use when the user asks to review a SKILL.md file. Scores frontmatter, body quality, structure, anti-patterns, and discoverability.
```

Pattern 3 — explicit trigger phrases (acceptable when no natural capability summary fits ≤160 chars):
```
Use when the user says "review my skill", "check this SKILL.md", or "does my skill follow best practices".
```

**Scope definition (recommended — prevents activation collision):**

Add a sentence clarifying what the skill does NOT handle:

```
...specifically for SKILL.md files — not CLAUDE.md, commands, or general markdown.
```

---

## Body Quality Rules

The body is everything after the closing `---` frontmatter delimiter.

### Size Limits

Skills are evaluated against two thresholds: line count (legacy check) and word count (per Anthropic's guide).

**Line count (per official Anthropic docs — under 500 lines for optimal performance):**

| Lines | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| <500 | Ideal |
| ≥500 | Exceeds limit — must split content into `references/` files |

**Word count (Anthropic guideline):**

| Words | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| <3,000 | Ideal — concise, focused |
| 3,000–4,999 | Acceptable; consider offloading detail to `references/` |
| ≥5,000 | Exceeds recommended limit — must split into `references/` or a Skill Pack |

Word count takes precedence when the two thresholds disagree. A 450-line file at 6,000 words still needs splitting.

### Content Quality

| Rule | Bad | Good |
|------|-----|------|
| Concrete examples | Abstract description only | Code block or before/after example |
| Consistent terminology | "task" then "job" then "operation" for same thing | Same term used throughout |
| Imperative voice | "You should read the file" | "Read the file" |
| No time-sensitive content | "As of 2024, Claude supports..." | "Claude supports..." (timeless) |
| No speculation | "This might work..." | Definitive instructions |

### Token Budget Consciousness

Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Before including an explanation, ask: "Does Claude need this, or does it already know it?"

**Verbose (avoid):**
```
# Before running this script, you need to make sure Python is installed.
# Python is a programming language. You can check by running python --version.
# If it's not installed, you can download it from python.org.
```

**Concise (preferred):**
```
Requires Python 3.8+. Install: brew install python3
```

Challenge each paragraph. Prune explanations of general concepts (what a JSON file is, how git works) — these waste context budget. Keep explanations of domain-specific behavior Claude cannot know (your team's conventions, specific tool quirks, expected output formats).

### Time-sensitive content (Error patterns)

Avoid any of these phrases:
- "as of [date/year]"
- "currently" (when referring to platform state)
- "recently added"
- "new in version X"
- "in the latest release"

These become incorrect as Claude Code evolves.

---

## Structure and Progressive Disclosure

### Three-Level Progressive Disclosure

Anthropic's guide defines a three-level system for how Claude loads skill content:

| Level | What | When Loaded | Implication |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Level 1** | YAML frontmatter (`name` + `description`) | Always — present in Claude's system prompt | Description determines whether the skill activates at all |
| **Level 2** | SKILL.md body | On activation — when Claude determines the skill applies | Must be self-contained enough to execute the skill |
| **Level 3** | Linked files (`references/`, `scripts/`) | On demand — loaded only when the task requires them | Offload detail here to keep SKILL.md body lean |

The frontmatter description carries outsized importance — if Claude does not understand when to use the skill from that description, the rest never loads.

### Folder Structure

**Folder naming:** Must use kebab-case (e.g., `sprint-planner`, `reviewing-skills`).

**SKILL.md filename:** Case-sensitive, must be exactly `SKILL.md` — no variations (`skill.md`, `Skill.md`).

**Minimum viable skill:**

```
my-skill/
└── SKILL.md
```

**Full skill structure (optional subdirectories):**

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           ← Required — core instructions
├── scripts/           ← Optional — executable Python or Bash scripts
├── references/        ← Optional — documentation loaded on demand
└── assets/            ← Optional — templates, config files, static resources
```

| Subdirectory | Purpose | Example Contents |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| `scripts/` | Executable automation scripts | `generate-report.py`, `setup.sh` |
| `references/` | Extended documentation loaded by Claude on demand | `best-practices.md`, `api-reference.md` |
| `assets/` | Templates, config samples, static resources | `template.html`, `config.example.json` |

### Reference File Depth

Reference files must be at exactly one level below the skill root:

| Valid | Invalid |
|-------|---------|
| `references/best-practices.md` | `references/sub/best-practices.md` |
| `references/audit-steps.md` | `references/steps/audit/step3.md` |

Claude Code resolves reference paths relative to the skill directory. Nested paths are not supported.

### Skill Packs

When a skill grows too large or serves multiple related purposes, split it into a **Skill Pack** — multiple skills in one plugin directory.

**When to split:**
- Single skill exceeds 5,000 words even after using `references/`
- Skill serves two distinct user intents that rarely overlap
- Users need to invoke sub-workflows independently

**Example (two skills in one plugin):**

```
plugins/memory-tools/
├── skills/
│   ├── agentic-memory-management/   ← Skill 1: audit CLAUDE.md files
│   │   └── SKILL.md
│   └── path-rules-advisor/      ← Skill 2: create .claude/rules/ files
│       └── SKILL.md
```

Each skill has its own `SKILL.md` with independent frontmatter and triggers. Avoid creating skill packs for tightly coupled workflows that always run together.

### Table of Contents

**Reference files** (`references/*.md`) at or exceeding 100 lines must have a TOC at the top. This requirement applies to reference files only — not to SKILL.md itself. Per Anthropic's official guide: "For reference files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top."

Adding a TOC to SKILL.md is a suggestion (improves navigation for long files) but is not required and should not be scored as a Warning.

TOC format:

```markdown
## Table of Contents

- [Section Name](#section-name)
  - [Subsection](#subsection)
```

### Freedom Level

Indicate how strictly the skill should be followed. This prevents Claude from over-adapting or under-adapting:

| Freedom Level | When to Use | Signal Phrase |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Rigid | Workflows where deviation causes errors | "Follow these steps exactly." |
| Flexible | Patterns that adapt to context | "Adapt these principles to the situation." |
| Suggested | Loose guidance | "Consider these approaches." |

If unspecified, Claude defaults to flexible — which may be wrong for process-critical skills.

### Heading Hierarchy

- Use H2 (`##`) for major sections
- Use H3 (`###`) for subsections
- Do not skip levels (no H2 → H4)
- Do not use H1 (`#`) inside the body (the frontmatter `name` serves as the title)

---

## Workflow Patterns

Beyond the four Anthropic design patterns, skills can use specific content patterns to make complex workflows easier to follow.

### Checklist Workflow

For complex multi-step tasks, present steps as a copyable checklist. Users (or Claude) can copy the checklist and mark steps off as they complete them.

```markdown
## Deployment Checklist

Copy this checklist and check off each step:

- [ ] Run `npm test` — all tests passing
- [ ] Update version in `package.json`
- [ ] Build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Deploy: `npm run deploy`
- [ ] Verify smoke tests pass in production
- [ ] Post deployment note in #deployments Slack channel
```

Use when: tasks have many steps that can fail independently, order matters, and the user may need to pause and resume.

### Feedback Loop

For quality-critical or iterative output, define an explicit validator → fix → repeat cycle. Do not assume Claude will iterate without instructions to do so.

```markdown
## Revision Loop

1. Generate initial draft
2. Run validator: `npm run lint`
3. If errors: fix each error, then repeat from step 2
4. Stop when: zero errors, or maximum 3 iterations reached
5. If still failing after 3 iterations: surface errors to user
```

Include a stop condition to prevent infinite loops.

### Template Pattern

Two variants — choose based on how strictly the output should match:

**Strict template** (ALWAYS use exactly as shown):
```markdown
## Commit Message Template

ALWAYS use this format exactly:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```
```

**Flexible template** (use as default, adapt as needed):
```markdown
## Report Template

Use the following as the default structure. Adapt sections to fit the actual findings:
```
## Summary
## Issues Found
## Recommendations
```
```

### Conditional Workflow

When a skill must handle multiple task types with different approaches, use explicit decision branches:

```markdown
## Step 1: Determine File Type

- If `.ts` or `.tsx` → proceed to [TypeScript Path](#typescript-path)
- If `.py` → proceed to [Python Path](#python-path)
- If `.md` → proceed to [Markdown Path](#markdown-path)
- If unknown → ask user: "What language is this file?"
```

Include an explicit fallback for unexpected inputs.

## Design Patterns

Anthropic's guide codifies four design patterns for skills. Identifying which pattern a skill follows helps assess whether its structure is appropriate.

| Pattern | Use When | Structure Signals |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Sequential / Pipeline** | Multi-step processes in a specific order | Numbered steps, phase markers, rollback instructions |
| **Orchestrator** | Workflows spanning multiple services or tools | MCP tool calls, API integrations, service coordination |
| **Iterative / Refinement** | Output quality improves with iteration | Draft → review → refine loops, quality gates, revision limits |
| **Adaptive** | Same outcome, different tools depending on context | Conditional branching, file-type detection, environment checks |

**Sequential / Pipeline** is the most common pattern for Claude Code skills. Look for numbered steps, `TodoWrite` progress tracking, and explicit "do not skip steps" instructions.

**Orchestrator** skills coordinate external services — expect references to MCP tools, API endpoints, or cross-service workflows.

**Iterative / Refinement** skills produce high-stakes output where first-draft quality is insufficient. Look for revision loops and quality thresholds.

**Adaptive** skills handle the same goal with different approaches based on context (e.g., different linters for different languages).

A skill may combine patterns — a Sequential skill with an Adaptive sub-step is common. The primary pattern should be clearly signalled in the body structure.

## Anti-patterns

Anti-patterns by severity:

### Error Level (must fix)

| Anti-pattern | Description | Fix |
|--------------|-------------|-----|
| `$ARGUMENTS` in skill | `$ARGUMENTS` only works in commands | Remove or replace with conversation context instructions |
| `$PWD` in skill | `$PWD` only works in commands | Remove or replace with file resolution logic |
| XML in description | `<example>`, `<user>` tags | Remove all XML tags from description field |
| First/second person in description | "I will...", "You should..." | Rewrite in third person |
| Reserved word in name | `claude-helper`, `anthropic-tool` | Choose a name without the reserved substrings |
| Windows paths | `references\file.md` | Use forward slashes: `references/file.md` |
| Reference depth >1 | `references/sub/file.md` | Flatten to `references/file.md` |
| Wrong SKILL.md casing | `skill.md`, `Skill.md` | Must be exactly `SKILL.md` (case-sensitive) |
| Hardcoded absolute paths | `/Users/me/project/data.json` | Use relative paths or file-resolution logic |

### Warning Level (should fix)

| Anti-pattern | Description | Fix |
|--------------|-------------|-----|
| Missing "Use when..." | Trigger phrase absent from description | Add "Use when the user asks to..." |
| Options without a default | Presents 3 options with no recommended default | Designate a default option |
| Time-sensitive content | Platform state described as of a specific date | Rewrite as timeless fact |
| Missing TOC on long file | File >100 lines lacks navigation | Add table of contents |
| Vague trigger phrase | "Use when user asks anything about code" | Make trigger specific to this skill's domain |
| Exceeds 5,000 words | SKILL.md body is too long for efficient loading | Split into `references/` files or a Skill Pack |
| Non-kebab-case folder name | `mySkill/`, `My_Skill/` | Use `my-skill/` |

### Suggestion Level (consider fixing)

| Anti-pattern | Description | Fix |
|--------------|-------------|-----|
| No concrete examples | Abstract instructions only | Add a before/after or code block example |
| Missing scope definition | Description doesn't say what skill won't do | Add scope exclusion sentence |
| Fewer than 3 keywords | Description not searchable | Add domain-specific terms |
| Freedom level unstated | Reader must infer rigidity | Add "Follow these steps exactly" or "Adapt to context" |
| Imperative voice avoided | "You should" instead of direct imperatives | Use "Do X" not "You should do X" |
| No design pattern visible | Skill body has no structural pattern | Consider adopting Sequential, Orchestrator, Iterative, or Adaptive pattern |
| Missing cross-platform note | Skill uses Claude-Code-only features without noting it | Add note if skill depends on CLI-specific features (e.g., `Bash` tool) |

### Script Quality Anti-patterns

These apply when the skill contains a `scripts/` folder reference or has bash/python code blocks with external tool invocations.

**Detection rule:** Check for any of: a `scripts/` directory, code blocks tagged ` ```bash ` or ` ```python ` containing CLI invocations (`curl`, `npm`, `pip`, `brew`, MCP tool calls).

| Anti-pattern | Severity | Description | Fix |
|--------------|----------|-------------|-----|
| Assumes tools/packages installed | Warning | Script calls `npm`, `pip`, or external tools without confirming they're available | Add required packages with install commands |
| MCP tool without `ServerName:` prefix | Warning | `tool_name` instead of `ServerName:tool_name` | Use fully qualified format: `GitHub:create_issue` |
| Voodoo constants | Suggestion | Magic numbers (`timeout=30`, `retries=3`) with no explanation | Add inline comment justifying the value |
| Punts to Claude on error | Warning | Script fails and lets Claude improvise recovery | Add explicit error handling: `if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then echo "Error: ..."; exit 1; fi` |
| Verbose over-explanation | Suggestion | Explains things Claude already knows (what JSON is, how git works) | Remove; keep only domain-specific context |

**Solve, don't punt:** A script that fails silently forces Claude to improvise recovery, producing inconsistent results. Scripts must handle their own failure modes.

**Clear execution intent:** Distinguish "Run this script" (Claude should execute it) from "Read this script as reference" (Claude should understand its logic). Ambiguity causes misuse.

---

## MCP Tool References

When a skill references MCP tools, always use the fully qualified `ServerName:tool_name` format.

**Bad — causes "tool not found" errors:**
```
Call create_issue with the title and body.
```

**Good — unambiguous:**
```
Call GitHub:create_issue with the title and body.
```

If two MCP servers expose tools with the same name (e.g., both `GitHub` and `GitLab` have `create_issue`), the unqualified name is ambiguous. The `ServerName:` prefix eliminates the ambiguity.

List required MCP servers in the skill body or in a `requirements` note:

```markdown
**Required MCP servers:** GitHub (for `GitHub:create_issue`, `GitHub:list_repos`)
```

---

## Regression Risk

The 1–10 quality score reflects the current state of a SKILL.md file in isolation. **Regression risk is evaluated separately** and does not affect any dimension score. A skill can score 10/10 and still introduce a breaking change if `name:` was renamed or a trigger phrase was removed. When reviewing a modified skill, the Regression Risk section (Step 2c) compares the current file against its last committed version and classifies changes as BREAKING, WARNING, or INFO. This is an informational overlay on top of the quality audit, not a scoring dimension.

---

## Evaluation-Driven Development

Build evaluations before writing extensive skill documentation. An evaluation lets you observe real behavior before optimizing words.

**Evaluation structure:**

```yaml
query: "Review the SKILL.md at plugins/my-plugin/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md"
expected_behavior:
  - Reads the target file
  - Scores all 5 dimensions
  - Produces a report with grade
  - Offers to generate corrected version
files:
  - plugins/my-plugin/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

**Iterative refinement cycle:**

1. **Claude A (author)** writes the skill
2. **Claude B (agent using skill)** attempts a real task with it
3. **Observe** — what did Claude B do that you didn't expect?
4. **Refine** — add a rule, clarify an instruction, or remove ambiguity

Repeat until behavior is consistent across 3–5 representative queries. This is faster than trying to anticipate every edge case upfront.

---

## Discoverability Patterns

### Trigger Phrase Structure

The `description` field is the only signal Claude uses to decide whether to activate a skill. Make triggers specific and multi-phrased:

**Pattern 1 — Intent + phrases:**
```
Reviews X for Y. Use when the user asks to [action], [action], or [action].
```

**Pattern 2 — Explicit triggers:**
```
Use when the user says "[phrase1]", "[phrase2]", or asks about [topic].
```

**Pattern 3 — Scope exclusion:**
```
...specifically for SKILL.md files — not CLAUDE.md, commands, or general markdown.
```

### Keyword Density

Include at least 3 domain-specific, searchable keywords in the description. These help Claude match user intent:

| Domain | Example Keywords |
|--------|-----------------|
| Skill authoring | `SKILL.md`, `skill quality`, `skill authoring`, `best practices` |
| Code review | `code review`, `bugs`, `security`, `quality` |
| Accessibility | `WCAG`, `a11y`, `accessibility`, `screen reader` |

Avoid generic keywords: "tool", "helper", "utility", "assistant".

### Activation Collision Risk

Two skills with similar descriptions may both activate — or neither activates reliably. To reduce collision risk:

1. Make trigger phrases distinct from related skills
2. Add scope exclusion (what the skill does NOT do)
3. Use domain-specific terms the other skill doesn't use

**Example (collision risk):**
```yaml
# Skill A
description: Reviews files for quality. Use when user asks to review files.

# Skill B
description: Reviews files for best practices. Use when user asks to review files.
```

**Example (collision avoided):**
```yaml
# Skill A
description: Reviews SKILL.md files against authoring best practices. Use when user asks to audit a SKILL.md specifically — not CLAUDE.md or commands.

# Skill B
description: Reviews CLAUDE.md files for compliance with Claude Code conventions. Use when user asks to audit or optimize CLAUDE.md — not skill files or commands.
```
