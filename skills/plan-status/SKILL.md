## Plan Status

Determine whether a plan has been implemented by inspecting the codebase, then
write the lifecycle status and dates into the plan file's YAML frontmatter.

Follow these steps exactly.

## When not to use

Does not stress-test, validate, or critique plan content — use review-plan or the built-in interview for that.

## Bulk mode (directory / `--all`)

When `$ARGUMENTS` names a directory or contains `--all`, process every `*.md`
plan in that directory in one pass with a summary-first, bulk-approval UX
(instead of per-file confirmation). Resolve the directory as: explicit argument
→ `plansDirectory` setting → `${PWD}/docs/plans/`. `--force` re-analyzes files
that already have a `status`.

Create TodoWrite progress todos, then run:

1. **Discover** — glob `*.md`; announce `"Found N plan files in [dir]"`; stop if zero.
2. **Triage** — read the first 10 lines of each file and bucket it:

   | Group | Condition | Default action |
   |-------|-----------|----------------|
   | A | No frontmatter | Analyze + add frontmatter |
   | B | Frontmatter, no `status` | Analyze + add `status` |
   | C | `status: todo`/`in-progress` | Skip unless `--force` |
   | D | `status: completed` | Skip unless `--force` |
   | E | `status: draft` | Skip unless `--force` |
   | F | Non-canonical `status`/`type` | Always process — normalize |

   Group F normalizes legacy values: `implemented`→`completed`, `ready`→`in-progress`,
   `proposed`→`draft`, `artifact`→`completed`; legacy `type: standard`/`artifact`
   are re-inferred in step 5. Present a triage summary and get bulk approval via
   `AskUserQuestion` ("Proceed / Cancel") before touching anything.
3. **Git dates (batch)** — one shell loop over the processing set applying the
   same date rules as Step 2 (empty created → today; modified == created → omit).
4. **Evidence (batch)** — score each file exactly as Step 4, but with a
   **stricter token filter**: include only paths with project prefixes
   (`plugins/`, `src/`, `.claude/`, `docs/`, `tests/`) or code extensions, and
   PascalCase/camelCase identifiers >3 chars; exclude version strings, JSON value
   fragments, API routes, and git refs. A file with no qualifying tokens gets
   provisional `todo` flagged `no signals` — do not prompt per file.
5. **Type (batch)** — classify completed files with the Step 5 rules; always
   re-infer legacy `type: standard`/`artifact`.
6. **Summary + approval** — output a results table (file, status, type, tokens,
   evidence %, dates, flags) plus aggregated stats. Flags: `no signals`,
   `docs plan` (token scoring may be off), `normalized` (Group F). Ask via
   `AskUserQuestion`: "Write all" / "Override some, then write" / "Export only"
   / "Cancel". For overrides, ask one question per group (normalized, type
   mismatches, review-flagged, no-signals, or specific file numbers), then
   confirm the final count.
7. **Write** — only on confirmation, applying the Step 7 field rules. Hybrid
   write: prepend YAML via a `Bash` loop for files without frontmatter; use
   `Edit` for files that already have it. Emit progress every 10 files and a
   final `updated / skipped / errors` summary.

## Instructions

### Step 0 — Create progress todos

Before doing anything else, use `TodoWrite` to create todos for each step:

- Step 1: Resolve plan file
- Step 2: Get file dates from git
- Step 3: Read existing frontmatter
- Step 4: Analyze codebase for implementation evidence
- Step 5: Artifact check (if applicable)
- Step 6: Present findings and confirm
- Step 7: Update plan file frontmatter

Mark each todo `status: "completed"` as you finish that step.

### Step 1 — Resolve plan file (or route to bulk mode)

**Bulk-mode routing:** If `$ARGUMENTS` names a directory, or contains `--all`,
follow [Bulk mode](#bulk-mode-directory----all) instead of the single-file
steps below. Otherwise continue with the single-file priority order.

Use the first match from this priority order:

1. **Argument**: If a file path appears in `$ARGUMENTS` or the user's message,
   use it directly.
2. **Currently open file**: If no path was given, check whether a `.md` file is
   currently open in the IDE. If it looks like a plan (contains headings like
   `## Implementation`, `## Plan`, `## Steps`, `## Context`, or `## Summary`),
   use it.
3. **Settings `plansDirectory`**: Read the `"plansDirectory"` key following
   Claude Code's settings precedence — project-local `.claude/settings.local.json`,
   then project `.claude/settings.json`, then global `~/.claude/settings.json`. Use
   the first that sets it; glob `*.md` files from that path and use the most
   recently modified file.
4. **Default fallback**: Glob `${PWD}/docs/plans/*.md`, sort by modification
   time, use the most recently modified file.

If no file is found via any method, tell the user and stop.

Announce the resolved file: `"Checking plan status: path/to/plan.md"`

### Step 2 — Get file dates from git

Use `Bash` to run git commands. Do not use `stat` — it is not cross-platform.

**Created date** (first in order that succeeds):

```bash
git log --follow --diff-filter=A --format="%cd" --date=short -- <file> | tail -1
```

If the command returns empty (file not tracked by git), use today's date as the
created date.

**Modified date**:

```bash
git log -1 --format="%cd" --date=short -- <file>
```

If the modified date equals the created date, treat `modified` as absent (omit
it from frontmatter).

### Step 3 — Read existing frontmatter

Read the plan file and parse its YAML frontmatter if present.

- If the existing `status` is `artifact` (legacy format), inform the user:
  _"This plan uses the legacy `artifact` status. It will be normalized to
  `status: completed`."_ Treat the status as `completed` for the remainder of
  the flow and continue to Step 5 so the content type is classified.
- If a `status` field already exists (and is not the legacy `artifact`),
  surface the current value to the user and
  ask via `AskUserQuestion`: _"This plan already has status `[value]`. Would
  you like to re-analyze the codebase or keep the current status?"_
  - If the user chooses to keep it, skip Steps 4–5 and go directly to Step 6
    to confirm whether to update the dates.
  - If the user chooses to re-analyze, continue from Step 4.
- If no frontmatter or no `status` field exists, continue from Step 4.

**Type**: Type is classified in **Step 5 only**, and only when status resolves
to `completed`. Do not infer or write `type` during this step.

### Step 4 — Analyze codebase for implementation evidence

**Extract inline backtick tokens only** from the plan body. Do not scan fenced
code block content (anything between ` ``` ` delimiters). Look for tokens that
appear to be:

- File paths: contain `/` or end in a known extension (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.md`,
  `.json`, `.py`, `.js`, `.css`, `.scss`)
- Named identifiers: PascalCase or camelCase words, kebab-case names that match
  command/skill naming patterns

Examples of tokens to extract: `` `plugins/plan-agent/SKILL.md` ``,
`` `plan-status` ``, `` `FooComponent` ``, `` `commands/plan-status.md` ``

If **no inline backtick tokens** are found in the plan body, skip codebase
analysis entirely. Instead, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "No extractable implementation signals found in this plan (no backtick-quoted
> file paths or names). Please set the status manually."

Offer options (default: `todo`): `todo`, `in-progress`, `completed`, `draft`. Use the
user-selected value as the status and proceed to Step 6.

**For each extracted token**, check both:

1. Use `Glob` to test whether it matches an existing file path in the project
2. Use `Grep` to test whether it appears as an identifier in the codebase (for
   named identifiers)

**Score the results:**

- 0% of tokens found → status = `todo`
- 1–79% of tokens found → status = `in-progress`
- 80%+ of tokens found → status = `completed`

### Step 5 — Type classification _(only when status resolves to `completed`)_

Infer content type from the plan's filename, H1 heading, and first 200 words
of body text. Apply the first matching rule:

| Signal | Inferred type |
|--------|---------------|
| Filename starts with `fix-`, `bugfix-`, or H1/body contains "bug", "fix", "patch", "regression" | `fix` |
| Filename starts with `refactor-`, `restructure-`, `simplify-`, or H1/body contains "refactor", "restructure", "simplify" | `refactor` |
| Filename starts with `document-`, `add-docs-`, `update-readme-`, or H1/body contains "documentation", "readme", "guide", "changelog" | `docs` |
| Filename starts with `bump-`, `rename-`, `update-version-`, `cleanup-`, or H1/body contains "chore", "housekeeping", "version bump", "rename" | `chore` |
| Default (no strong signal or filename starts with `add-`, `create-`, `implement-`, `build-`) | `feature` |

If the file already has a valid content type (`feature`, `fix`, `refactor`,
`docs`, `chore`), keep it.

### Step 6 — Present findings and confirm

Output a summary table in the chat:

```text
| Field    | Value                         |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| File     | docs/plans/my-feature.md      |
| Status   | in-progress                   |
| Type     | feature                       |
| Created  | 2026-01-15                    |
| Modified | 2026-03-26                    |
| Evidence | 3/5 tokens found in codebase  |
```

List found tokens (with file or grep match) and missing tokens separately.

Then ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "Should I update this plan file's YAML frontmatter with status `[value]`?"

**Do NOT write to the file unless the user confirms.**

### Step 7 — Update plan file frontmatter

Only on user confirmation.

If the file has no existing YAML frontmatter, insert a new block at the very
top of the file:

```yaml
---
status: in-progress
type: feature
created: 2026-01-15
modified: 2026-03-26
---
```

If the file already has YAML frontmatter, update or add only the `status`,
`type`, `created`, and `modified` fields. Preserve all other existing fields
exactly as they are. Never rename or remove existing fields.

Rules:

- Omit `modified` if it equals `created`
- Use `Edit` tool for all file writes
- After writing, confirm to the user: `"Frontmatter updated in path/to/plan.md"`
